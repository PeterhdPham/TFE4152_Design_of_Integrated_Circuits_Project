\subsection{Aimspice results}

After running a few simulations with different voltages and dimmensions we ended up with the prefered parameters in table \ref{tab:MOSFET_parameters}. Note: the some plots have a typo where it says P\_W instead of $W_P$.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{MOSFET parameters}
    \label{tab:MOSFET_parameters}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Parameter & Value \\ \hline
        $V_{DD}$& 0.6V  \\
        $W_N$ & 100nm \\
        $L_N$ & 100nm \\
        $W_P$ & 300nm \\
        $L_P$ & 100nm     
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The static leakage power can be seen in the bargraphs on figure \ref{fig:static_leakage_power_bar}.

The mean of the static leakage power for every scenario I1-I4 mentioned in Table \ref{{tab:static_states}} are presented in table \ref{tab:leakage_power}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Mean static leakage power}
    \label{tab:leakage_power}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Corner} & \textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{Mean Leakage Power} \\
    \hline
    TT & 0  & $1.560 nW$\\
    TT & 27 & $1.278 nW$\\
    TT & 70 & $3.042 nW$\\
    FF & 0  & $1.065 nW$\\
    FF & 27 & $2.243 nW$\\
    FF & 70 & $3.894 nW$\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The functionality for each corner can be seen on the figures \ref{fig:aimspice_W1_0} to \ref{fig:aimspice_W3_70}

The computed static leakage power with respect to the chosen $V_{DD}\pm 0.2V$ and with respect to the chosen $W_P\pm 0.2\mu m$ can be seen in the figures \ref{fig:0.3_I1_I2}, \ref{fig:0.3_I3_I4} \ref{fig:0.6_I1_I2} and \ref{fig:0.6_I3_I4}. The dotes are the actual values computed while the the lines are fitted line with a degree of 5 to aid in the visualisation of the trends regardig the variables. Note that the x-axis in for the figures \ref{fig:0.6_I1_I2}, \ref{fig:0.6_I3_I4} and \ref{fig:0.6_delay} are given in $\mu m$.
