\subsection{Test and simulate in Verilog}
To see the results we used verilog as mentioned.
\import{./Verilog}{TEST MAC.tex}
\import{./Verilog}{TEST FSM.tex}
\subsubsection{FULL SYSTEM}
Full wrong- delta delay
The test of the complete system, involves constant input values $A$ and $B$, and the first scenario we are testing an ideal scenario with no change on input $RESET=0$ and $RUN=1$.

\begin{lstlisting}
    module TEST_AWESOME_3;
    
	reg run;
	reg clk;
	reg reset;
	wire [0:7] c;
	reg [0:1] a;
	reg [0:1] b;
	AWESOME_VOL_3 A3( .A(a) ,.B(b), .C(c) ,.RUN(run) ,.CLK(clk) ,.RESET(reset) );	
	initial begin
    a = 2'b11;
    end	  
	initial begin
    b=2'b01;
	end	
	initial begin
    clk=1'b0;
    forever #1	clk=~clk;
	end
	initial begin
    reset=1'b1; #2; reset=1'b0;
	end;
	initial begin  
    run=1'b1; end;
	initial begin
    #100;
     $finish;
	 end
	 endmodule
	\end{lstlisting}

	The output $C$ had an unexcepted behaviour as it updated on every $CLK$ cycle and didn't follow the $CLK_{OUTPUT}$. This is because of a glitch in Active HDL caused by delta delay \cite{delta}. The way we manipluated it was by setting in a delay on the $CLK_{OUT}$ and $RESET_{OUT}$ signal from the FSM, as shown in figure
	
	\importimagewcaption{figures/drawio/RTL/RTL_FSM.png}{Insert delay on the output for the FSM}

	After this modification we got an excepted result as the Figure \ref{fig:figures/Verylog/FULL.right_ideal.PNG} shows, where it follows the $CLK_{OUT}$ pattern.
\importimagewcaption{figures/Verylog/FULL.right_ideal.PNG}{IDEAL}

The next scenario, was to see what happend when \textbf{RESET} got changed suddenly, the difference between the current testbench and the ideal is the updated value in reset:

\begin{lstlisting}
	initial begin
		reset=1'b1; #2; reset=1'b0; #32; reset=1'b1; #10;reset=1'b0;
	end
\end{lstlisting}
\importimagewcaption{figures/Verylog/FULL.RESET.PNG}{RESET}
Figure \ref{fig:figures/Verylog/FULL.RESET.PNG} shows excepted behaviour, the value gets updated by the rising edge of $CLK$ and $C$ value gets retset.

The next scenario, was to see what happend when \textbf{RUN} got changed suddenly, the difference between the current testbench and the ideal is the updated value in run:
\begin{lstlisting}
	initial begin  
		run=1'b1; #32; run=1'b0; #10; run=1'b1;
	end;
\end{lstlisting}
\importimagewcaption{figures/Verylog/FULL.RUN.PNG}{RUN}
Figure \ref{fig:figures/Verylog/FULL.RUN.PNG} shows excepted behaviour, where $C$ dosen't update its value while $RUN=0$. And 3+1 pattern contious from where it left after $RUN$ goes back to 0.
