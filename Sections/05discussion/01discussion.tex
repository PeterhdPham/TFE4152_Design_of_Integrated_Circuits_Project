\section{What we have left}

\subsection{Aimspice}
What remains is to run more simulation at diffrent Mosfet parameters (width, lenght and Vdd) we do also want to measure the leakage current for diffrent states and scenarios to se if there is any scenarios that are more favorable to measure. As we se that our DFF works as intendend for all scenarios and are quite consistent as well, we think that the discrepancies in the current measurement are a result of bad simulation and measurement than errors in our code and circuit.

We do also see that we have unexpected plots where the output of the DFF spikes a little before switching state from high to low or that the output voltage oscilates a little after switching as seen in figure \ref{fig:aimspice_W3_0}
