\subsection{FSM} \label{FSM}
FSM or a \emph{Finite state machin} are used track sequence of events. As shown in Fig, (figur av statediagram) All FSMs consist of two parts: state, shown as circles, and transitions, shown as arcs from one state to another. (ref til datdig, side 290). Each state represents one possible situation the FSM can be in.

\textbf{Mealy} and \textbf{Moore machines} are two types of finite state machin. In a \textbf{Mealy machines} the output is determined by both the current state and the present input. While in a \textbf{Moore machine} output value only dependson the present state, making its behavior independent of immediate input changes.
