\subsection{MOS}
MOS short for metal-oxide semiconductor are as of now, the most used technology in microcircuits are MOS transistors. These circuits consist primarily of n-channel (NMOS) and p-channel (PMOS) transistors, and when a microcircuit consist of both NMOS and PMOS transistors it's called a complementary MOS (CMOS).\cite[p. 14]{carusone_2012_analog}

MOS transistors consist mainly of $n^+$ source and drain region
