\subsection{MAC}
The Mac(multiply-accumulate opperation)- operations can be described by Equation \ref{eq:MAC}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MAC}
    C\leftarrow C+A*B
\end{equation}
Since the Mac have both addition and multiplication opperations, a natural way forward will be implementing arithmetic circiuts with adders and multipliers. In addition the \emph{accumulate} aspect of the MAC necessitates a mechanism for retaining the previous value of  \textbf{C}. This has to be stored somehow, and implies that storage or memory functionality is an integral part of the MAC operation.
