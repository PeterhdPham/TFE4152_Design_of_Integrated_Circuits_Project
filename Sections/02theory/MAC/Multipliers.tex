\subsubsection{Multiplier}
The simplest way to describe a multiplier, is by compare it to an $AND  gate$. An $AND gate$ processes two single-bit inputs and produces a single-bit output, showing the basic multiplication operation in binary arithmetic. Howeever, this projects involves two 2-bits input, $A$ and $B$, wich recuire more complecity circiut than an simplified $AND gate$. Fig [ref fra video] illustrates a possible realization for a 2-bit Multiplier.
