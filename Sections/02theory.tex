\section{Theory}

Modern computers typically consist of multiple levels\cite[Page 2]{tanenbaum_2012_structured}, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Computer-level.png}. Based on the figure, AI would likely be categorized under Level 5. While the figure indicates that Level 0, the \textbf{Digital Logic Level}, is the lowest level, there exists another level beneath it, known as the \textbf{Device Level}. At this level, designers engage with individual transistors. To comprehend the inner workings of these transistors, one must delve into solid-state physics and understand integrated circuits.
