\section{Conclusion}

We can conclude that with the given specification and constraints. The 1-bit version of our register implemented in AIMSpice satisfies both the goal of minimizing the static leakage power while making sure that keeping the performance respectable. This was done by using the theory at hand as a base for the methods used, then accompanied by a lot of simulations that further prove the theory itself. Even though there was a few outliers and inconsistent dataponts when computing the static leakage power, it was still sufficient to give a treng and idea of how the circuit behaves.
