\section{Method}
In this project, we have implemented a unit that executes the multiply-accumulate
operation (hereafter called the MAC unit) and a finite state machine (FSM) which creates
signals used to control the MAC unit. The process are been divided into two sepparate but integrated parts where we are to implement a 1-bit version of register used to store the accumulated value in the MAC unit in AIMSpice. Then we have implemented the whole system using Verilog in ActiveHDL.
